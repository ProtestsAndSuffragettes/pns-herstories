## Release automation

This plugin belongs to the root `bnjmnrsh/pns` repository; do not create a
nested Git repository or a plugin-local GitHub release workflow. Use the global
`$release-please` skill before configuring or operating its release automation.

The root Release Please manifest must model `pns-herstories` as an independent
component at `app/public/wp-content/plugins/pns-herstories`, using
component-tagged releases. Keep the plugin header and
`PNS_HERSTORIES_VERSION` constant in `pns-herstories.php` aligned. The root
manifest must explicitly update every nonstandard WordPress version source.

Preserve the existing `0.1.0` version in the bootstrap manifest and validate
the generated release PR before merging it.
